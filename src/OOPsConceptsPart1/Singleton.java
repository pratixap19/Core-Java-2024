// In oops, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object/instance at a time
//how to design singleton class
//1. make constructor as a private
//2. write a public static method(getInstance) that has return type of object of this singleton 
//3. By creating static object
//class which is called Lazy initialization.
//what is difference between normal class and singleton class?
//In normal class constructor is used to create object where as in singleton class getInstance() method is used to create object  
public class Singleton {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		

	}
